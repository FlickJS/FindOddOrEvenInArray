## Three methods for finding the odd or even number in array full of odd/even numbers.

I run tests on these methods to check the performance of on the array named even with the 500001 elements.

As you can see function search3 is the fastest way to find the odd/even number in array full of odd/even numbers. It use the less memory then for example search2 where you need to create two new arrays.

There is also a method wrote in ES6 which you can write in one line, but performance leaves much to be desired.
